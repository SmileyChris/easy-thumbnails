=======================================
Optimizing Images using a Postprocessor
=======================================

The PIL and the Pillow libraries do a great job when is comes to crop, rotate or resize images.
However they both operate poorly when it comes to optimizing the payload of the generated files.
For this feature, two portable command line programs can fill the gap: jpegoptim_ and optipng_.
They both are Open Source, run on a huge range of platforms and can reduce the file size of an
image by often more than 50% without loss of quality.

Optimizing such images is a big benefit in terms of loading time and is therefore strongly
recommended by tools such as Google's PageSpeed_. Moreover, if every website operator cares about,
it reduces the overall Internet traffic and thus greenhouse gases by some googolth percent.

Installation and configuration
------------------------------
Install one or both of the above programs on your operating system.

In your Django project's settings module, add the optimizing postprocessor to your configuration
settings::

	INSTALLED_APP = (
	    ...
	    'easy_thumbnails',
	    'easy_thumbnails.optimize',
	    ...
	)

There is one configuration settings dictionary:

.. autoattribute:: easy_thumbnails.optimize.conf.OptimizeSettings.THUMBNAIL_OPTIMIZE_COMMAND

.. _jpegoptim: http://freecode.com/projects/jpegoptim
.. _optipng: http://optipng.sourceforge.net/
.. _PageSpeed: https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/
