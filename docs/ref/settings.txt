Settings
========

The following settings can be specified in your Django project's settings
module to alter the behaviour of easy-thumbnails.

THUMBNAIL_DEBUG
	Default: ``False``

	If this boolean setting is set to ``True``, display errors creating a
	thumbnail when using the :ref:`thumbnail_tag` rather than failing silently.

.. _setting-thumbnail_quality:

THUMBNAIL_QUALITY
	Default: ``85``

	The default quality level for JPG images on a scale from 1 (worst) to 95
	(best). Technically, values up to 100 are allowed, but this is not
	recommended.

THUMBNAIL_DEFAULT_STORAGE
	Default: ``'easy_thumbnails.storage.ThumbnailFileSystemStorage'``

	The default Django storage for thumbnails.

THUMBNAIL_MEDIA_ROOT
	Default: ``''``

	Used by easy-thumbnail's default storage to locate where thumbnails are
	stored on the file system.

	If not provided, Django's standard ``MEDIA_ROOT`` setting is used.

THUMBNAIL_MEDIA_URL
	Default: ``''``

	Used by easy-thumbnail's default storage to build the absolute URL for a
	generated thumbnail.

	If not provided, Django's standard ``MEDIA_URL`` setting is used.

THUMBNAIL_BASEDIR
	Default: ``''``

	Save thumbnail images to a directory directly off ``MEDIA_ROOT``, still
	keeping the relative directory structure of the source image.

	For example, using the ``{% thumbnail "photos/1.jpg" 150x150 %}`` tag with
	a ``THUMBNAIL_BASEDIR`` of ``'thumbs'`` would result in the following
	thumbnail filename::

		MEDIA_ROOT + 'thumbs/photos/1_jpg_150x150_q85.jpg'

THUMBNAIL_SUBDIR
	Default: ``''``

	Save thumbnail images to a sub-directory relative to the source image.

	For example, using the ``{% thumbnail "photos/1.jpg" 150x150 %}`` tag with
	a ``THUMBNAIL_SUBDIR`` of ``'thumbs'`` would result in the following
	thumbnail filename::

		MEDIA_ROOT + 'photos/thumbs/1_jpg_150x150_q85.jpg'

THUMBNAIL_PREFIX
	Default: ``''``

	Prepend thumbnail filenames with the specified prefix.

	For example, using the ``{% thumbnail "photos/1.jpg" 150x150 %}`` tag with
	a ``THUMBNAIL_PREFIX`` of ``'thumbs_'`` would result in the following
	thumbnail filename::

		MEDIA_ROOT + 'photos/thumbs_1_jpg_150x150_q85.jpg'

.. _setting-thumbnail_processors:

THUMBNAIL_PROCESSORS
	Default::

		(
		    'easy_thumbnails.processors.colorspace',
		    'easy_thumbnails.processors.autocrop',
		    'easy_thumbnails.processors.scale_and_crop',
		    'easy_thumbnails.processors.filters',
		)

	The :doc:`processors` through which the source image is run when you create
	a thumbnail.

	The order of the processors is the order in which they are sequentially
	called to process the image.

THUMBNAIL_SOURCE_GENERATORS
	Default::

		(
		    'easy_thumbnails.source_generators.pil_image',
		)

	The :doc:`source_generators` through which the base image is created from
	the source file. 

	The order of the processors is the order in which they are sequentially
	tried.

.. _setting-thumbnail_extension:

THUMBNAIL_EXTENSION
	Default: ``'jpg'``

	The type of image to save thumbnails with no transparency layer as.

	Note that changing the extension will most likely cause the
	``THUMBNAIL_QUALITY`` setting to have no effect.

.. _setting-thumbnail_transparency_extension:

THUMBNAIL_TRANSPARENCY_EXTENSION
	Default: ``'png'``

	The type of image to save thumbnails with a transparency layer (e.g. GIFs
	or transparent PNGs).
