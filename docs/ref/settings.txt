Settings
========

The following settings can be specified in your Django project's settings
module to alter the behaviour of easy-thumbnails.

.. _THUMBNAIL_DEBUG:

THUMBNAIL_DEBUG
	If this boolean setting (which defaults to ``False``) is set to ``True``,
	display errors creating a thumbnail when using the ``{% thumbnail %}`` tag
	rather than failing silently.

THUMBNAIL_DEFAULT_STORAGE
	The default Django storage for thumbnails.

	Defaults to ``'easy_thumbnails.storage.ThumbnailFileSystemStorage'``.

THUMBNAIL_MEDIA_ROOT
	Used by easy-thumbnail's default storage to locate where thumbnails are
	stored on the file system.

	If not provided, Django's standard ``MEDIA_ROOT`` setting is used.

THUMBNAIL_MEDIA_URL
	Used by easy-thumbnail's default storage to build the absolute URL for a
	generated thumbnail.

	If not provided, Django's standard ``MEDIA_URL`` setting is used.

THUMBNAIL_BASEDIR
	Save thumbnail images to a directory directly off ``MEDIA_ROOT``, still
	keeping the relative directory structure of the source image.

	For example, using the ``{% thumbnail "photos/1.jpg" 150x150 %}`` tag with
	a ``THUMBNAIL_BASEDIR`` of ``'thumbs'`` would result in the following
	thumbnail filename::

		MEDIA_ROOT + 'thumbs/photos/1_jpg_150x150_q85.jpg'

THUMBNAIL_SUBDIR
	Save thumbnail images to a sub-directory relative to the source image.

	For example, using the ``{% thumbnail "photos/1.jpg" 150x150 %}`` tag with
	a ``THUMBNAIL_SUBDIR`` of ``'thumbs'`` would result in the following
	thumbnail filename::

		MEDIA_ROOT + 'photos/thumbs/1_jpg_150x150_q85.jpg'

THUMBNAIL_PREFIX
	Prepend thumbnail filenames with the specified prefix.

	For example, using the ``{% thumbnail "photos/1.jpg" 150x150 %}`` tag with
	a ``THUMBNAIL_PREFIX`` of ``'thumbs_'`` would result in the following
	thumbnail filename::

		MEDIA_ROOT + 'photos/thumbs_1_jpg_150x150_q85.jpg'

THUMBNAIL_PROCESSORS
	The :doc:`processors` through which the source image is run when you create
	a thumbnail.

	The order of the processors is the order in which they are sequentially called
	to process the image.

THUMBNAIL_EXTENSION
	Specify which type of image to save thumbnails as. For example:

		THUMBNAIL_EXTENSION = 'png'

	Note that changing the extension causes the ``THUMBNAIL_QUALITY`` setting
	to have no effect.
